https://github.com/drmathias/csharp-skynet - C# Skynet SDK, which can handle file and directory uploads to Skynet, as well as file downloads in C#. It is based on C# abstract file system APIs, which means it can integrate with not just file system files, but also files stored on Azure Blob storage and embedded into binaries. I have created a dotnet CLI tool to demonstrate its use (see https://github.com/drmathias/skynet-cli).
